# faceID
FaceID meaning one can register his/her face by taking few pictures of him and later use the FaceID to identify the person.

One of the most discussed features of the new iPhone X is the new unlocking method, FaceID. 
Apple has revolutionized the way we unlock a phone: by simply looking at it. 
It uses front facing depth-camera for that. iPhone X in able to create a 3D map of the face of the user with that. 
In addition, a picture of the userâ€™s face is captured using an infrared camera, that is more robust to changes in light and color of 
the environment. Using deep learning, the smartphone is able to learn the user face in great detail, thus recognizing him\her every time 
the phone is picked up by its owner.
